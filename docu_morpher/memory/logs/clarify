The application must be able to extract both images and text from the PDF and place them accurately in the Word document, maintaining the original layout.\n\n2.0 Features and Functionality\nThe application must:\n\nExtract text from PDF files\nExtract images from PDF files\nMaintain the layout of the original PDF in the Word document\nHandle multi-page PDF documents\nExtract text from images (OCR)\nRecognize and properly place non-text elements (e.g., emojis) in the Word document\n3.0 Technologies\nThe application should be built using Python and utilize the following libraries:\n\nPyMuPDF for PDF parsing\npython-docx for Word document creation\nTesseract (pytesseract) for OCR\nspaCy or NLTK for natural language processing\nAn external image recognition API (like Google Cloud Vision or Amazon Rekognition)\n4.0 Architecture\nThe application should follow a modular architecture with separate modules for PDF parsing, image recognition, OCR, text processing, layout analysis, and Word document generation. This will allow us to update or replace individual modules without affecting the rest of the application.\n\nfinish and improove following code:\n\ncheck the following code:\n\n\nmain.py\nfrom pdf_parser import PDFParser\nfrom ocr_processor import OCRProcessor\nfrom image_recognizer import ImageRecognizer\nfrom text_processor import TextProcessor\nfrom layout_analyzer import LayoutAnalyzer\nfrom word_generator import WordGenerator\n\n\ndef main():\n    # Implementation here\n\n    if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n        main()\n\n\nimage_recognizer.py\nfrom typing import List\nimport requests\n\n\nclass ImageRecognizer:\n    def __init__(self, api_key: str):\n        self.api_key = api_key\n\n    def recognize_elements(self, images: List[bytes]) -> List[List[str]]: \n        # Implementation here\n\nlayout_analyzer.py\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n\nclass LayoutAnalyzer:\n    def __init__(self, layout_data: List[Tuple[float, float, float, float]]):\n        self.layout_data = layout_data\n\n    def analyze_layout(self) -> List[Tuple[int, int]]:\n        # Implementation here\n\nocr_processor.py\nfrom typing import List\nimport pytesseract\nfrom PIL import Image\n\n\nclass OCRProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r'/usr/local/bin/tesseract'\n\n    def perform_ocr(self, images: List[bytes]) -> List[str]:\n        # Implementation here\n\npdf_parser.py\nimport fitz  # PyMuPDF\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\n\n\nclass PDFParser:\n    def __init__(self, file_path: str):\n        self.file_path = file_path\n        self.doc = fitz.open(file_path)\n\n    def extract_text(self) -> List[str]:\n        # Implementation here\n\n    def extract_images(self) -> List[Tuple[int, bytes]]:\n        # Implementation here\n\n    def extract_layout(self) -> List[Tuple[float, float, float, float]]:\n        # Implementation here\n\ntext_processor.py\nfrom typing import List\nimport spacy\n\n\nclass TextProcessor:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.nlp = spacy.load(\"en_core_web_sm\")\n\n    def process_text(self, text: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n        # Implementation here\n\nword_generator.py\nfrom typing import List, Tuple\nfrom docx import Document\n\n\nclass WordGenerator:\n    def __init__(self, output_file: str):\n        self.output_file = output_file\n        self.doc = Document()\n\n    def create_word_document(self, text_data: List[str], layout_data: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> None:\n        # Implementation here\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Summary of areas that need clarification:\n\n1.
